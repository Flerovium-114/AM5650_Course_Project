# AM5650_Course_Project - On the Onset and Control of Chaos in Hysteretic Systems Using the Bouc–Wen Model

This repository contains the **MATLAB** codes for the course project for the course AM5650 - Non-Linear Dynamics. 
The main idea of the course project was to replicate the results of the paper Ngouoko et al. (2021) and provide an 
extension to it. MATLAB's stiff ode solver, *ode15s* is used for solving the non-linear ode. There is quite a number of files - 
one for each plot - as this way, it is easier for book-keeping. Go through the report attached along with this 
repository for a detailed explanation of the plots. Go through the reference articles for further reading.
